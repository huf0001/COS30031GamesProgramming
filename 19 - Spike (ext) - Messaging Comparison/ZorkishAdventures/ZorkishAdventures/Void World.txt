####World specification formatting for Zorkish Adventures--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#World Name 				"W:World Name"

#Starting Configuration 	"S:starting_location_id:available_command_id_1,available_command_id_2, . . ."
#						- Command types: all, alias, debug, look, open, move, take, put, drop, help, hiscore, quit
#						- Default commands: look, help, quit
#						- At least move or take must be made available from the start, so that the player can move to locations
#						  that unlock further commands, or pick up items that unlock further commands. In the latter case,
#						  at least the move command must be unlocked in that manner.

#Locations				"L:location_id:Location Name:location description".
#						- Default components: container, description.

#Paths	 				"P:path_id:Path Name:location_from_id:direction:location_to_id:path description".
#						- Default components: description. 
#						- If you leave path_id or Path Name blank, it'll construct them from location_from_id and location_to_id.

#Direction Aliases 		"A:direction name:direction alias"

#Items					"I:container_id:item_id:Item Name:item description:component_id_1,component_id_2, . . .". 
#						- Default components: description.

#Components				"C:component_type:game_object_id[:component-specific parameters]"

#						"C:container:game_object_id:is_open?:always_open?"

#						"C:description:game_object_id:description of game object"

#						"C:lock:game_object_id:is_locked?:unlockable_with_item_id_1,unlockable_with_item_id_2, . . .". 
#						- If not unlockable, specify "none".

#						"C:movable:game_object_id"

#						"C:unlock_commands:game_object_id:command_id_1,command_id_2, . . ."
#						- Should only be attached to Locations and/or Items.

#NOTE: Locations, Paths, Items and the Player are game objects, and thus can have components attached to them.

#WARNING: don't specify lock, description, or unlock_commands components in an item's base specification; ComponentFactory won't 
#return them, as it can't handle extra parameters. Those components require custom specification.
